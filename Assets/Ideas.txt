Type of game - Platformer with elements of:
Roguelite
Stealth
Shooter

More refined genre ideas:
Roguelite where the further you progress, the better gear you take back. Could possibly be some sort of extraction shooter
Infiltration game where you have to go into a place without dying, but the enemies are strong enough that the best strategy is not direct aggression
Game where you get items based on 'achievements' (kill x things, beat level in x seconds, etc.). Possibly have only 1 level that you repeat consistently

Visual theme ideas:
Forest
Industrial - Lots of metal, similar to Portal (very sterile and clean looking) or Portal 2 (decaying)
Military - Very fortified look, everything looks sturdy and controlled
Space - In spaceship (because gravity), lots of white and windows with stars in background, ties in with industrial
Body Horror - Lots of fleshy looking things (like Half-Life and Rainworld rot), meat tentacles, decaying fleshy structures

Emotional theme ideas:
Apocalypse - some form of (imminent or past) apocalyptic disaster
War - international war
1984 - basically only works with stealth aspects. Plays in with the war theme. Hunger Games esque revolution against a nearly all-seeing state

Artstyle ideas:
Pixelart
Pixel shader with normal art (Rainworld/Noita esque, but probably needs procedural animation and that shit hard so probably not this)
Grim
Vibrant


Upgrade system ideas:
Ctrl-C Ctrl-V the system of Noita (without the rest of Noita)
Have 1 movement, 1 weapon, 1 alt weapon, and 2 modifier slots. Movement can be things like dash/groundpound, weapon can be different guns/melee,
alt weapon can be things like grappling hook or just 2nd damage weapon, modifiers can be things like speed or firerate.
Have a set amount of points to use on different slots

More refined system ideas:
Have the movement/weapon/alt/modifier system and also the point system. Have 1 slot by default but can add slots for 'item modifiers' with points. This can be
things similar to Noita upgrades



Leaning towards:
Theme - unknown (not that relevant yet)
Genre - Shooter with extraction elements and some stealth/evasion (enemies too strong to fight multiple at once, so either run, hide, trap, or lure them out), you
go into an area where you sneak around and try and find items, before having to return somewhere to leave and use said items. If you die, all items get dropped
and you have to go back in and try and retrieve them (possible upgrades to negate some of the item loss)
System - Noita with the movement/weapon/alt/modifier system instead of wands. Need some form of points to unlock more slots under the type where you can put
items (Noita spells) to modify said behaviour


Priorities of development:
1. Create system (barebones, don't need lots of entries into each slot type)
2. Come up with how enemies should behave
3. Create pseudocode for enemies
4. Code pathfinding for enemies
5. Code enemies
6. Improve visuals (particle effects, post processing, 1-sprite art for enemies/player)
